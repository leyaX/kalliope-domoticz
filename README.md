FORKED: Corrections diverses pour kalliope 6.0

A neuron to leverage [domoticz](https://www.domoticz.com) API.

## Synopsis

Domoticz is a domotic tool to manage your different devices at home. It is extremely powerful and I use it manage some component via zwave.


**This module is not stable and I'm only starting developing it. Also I don't have a lot of z-wave devices so my tests are not exhaustive**
